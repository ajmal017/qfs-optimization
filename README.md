## Quick Overview
Purpose:

This repository serves as a partial record of work done as a member of the University of Maryland's Quantitative Finance Society. Specifically, this repository is concerned with developing user-friendly portfolio optimization functions for use in Quantopian.

Language:

Python 2.7.13

## Current Developments
Writing a function that implements mean-variance analysis by intaking a dictionary that maps integer SID keys to floating-point expected Return on Investment (ROI) values. The function itself returns the feasible, integer weights for the portoflio on the Markowitz Efficient Frontier with the lowest variance.

## Future Developments
Writing a function that returns a dictionary with all the feasible weights for any given variance and expected ROI. Implementing an interactive graph of the feasible portfolios; ideally, this graph's data can be exported.
