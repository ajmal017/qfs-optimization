## Changes

**Changes**:

Added actual functionality to the `modern_optimize()` function that interfaces with the Yahoo Finance historical data `csv`.

Two separate files were created; one for interfacing with Yahoo Finance and another for interfacing with Quantopian. Both are funtional, yet the latter is largely incomplete.
